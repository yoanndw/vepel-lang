# vepel-lang
The Vepel Language is a project of esoteric programming language, which is like a visual scripting in ASCII art.

Here is an example:
```
5--------->+------->$
           ^
3----------|
```
This code will first compute the sum of 5 and 3 (`5` and `3` nodes are linked to the `+` node), then print the result in the terminal (`$` node).

## Nodes
In the first version, the supported nodes are:
- `+`: adds the two nodes which are linked to it
- `$`: prints int the terminal the decimal value of a number

## **Warning**
**This project is still in progress, so it's unable to execute scripts such as the previous example.**
